    cd /usr/local/Library/Taps/homebrew-science
    git checkout ae74fe9 opencv.rb
    brew install opencv --with-tbb

## Hit it!

To get a fresh check out, and get the pieces information run:

    git clone git@github.com:quintel/theia.git
    cd theia
    bundle
    ./bin/theia
    
If you're just updating the code:

    git up
    bundle
    ./bin/theia

# How to calibrate

Assuming you've followed the steps above (installed OpenCV, ran `bundle` and copied the example pieces file), all you have to do is:

    ./bin/theia calibrate
